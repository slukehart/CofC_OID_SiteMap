    <p> Description: Participants will bring their favorite photos – digital or print – and share their stories with one another. Through sharing photographs of family and loved ones, participants will contribute and discover stories about themselves and one another revealing roots, connections, and provocative parallels that surprise and engage us in community. In addition to sharing photographs, scholars and community members will discuss the power of images for storytelling, identity, and representation in our public memory. Specimens of historic photographs including daguerreotypes, tintypes, cabinet cards, and stereoviews will also be on display.</p>
