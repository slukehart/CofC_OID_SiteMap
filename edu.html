Description: The Women of Color in Education (WCE) Leadership Program enhances the academic experience of teacher candidates through a discussion series focused on the contributions, development, and issues faced by educators who are women of color. The series will consist of three Zoom sessions (February, March, April) with a guest speaker or panel. 
February Session #1 For the Students: Understanding the Emotional Labor of Women of Color Educators 
March Session #2 Quality is NOT the issue: Navigating Microaggressions as a Professional Educator Applications for WCE Summer Exploration Experience due March 21

In March or April, students will be invited to apply for a paid Summer Exploration Experience during which they will participate in an experiential learning opportunity inspired by one of the Zoom sessions. Five students will be selected, and each will develop an individual project to complete in May and June. The group will convene via Zoom at least twice during the summer, including a final presentation.
